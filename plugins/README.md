# Plugins

Plugins facilitate easy integration with existing initiatives and technologies. They are small and focused on adding very specific functionality. On their own they might not add much but they can definitely enrich your project. 

Plugins can be categorized according to their purpose. Think for example of transport plugins that help implement Bluetooth, NFC or HTTP transport.
