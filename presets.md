# Presets

Where plugins are small and focussed, presets are broad and made up of combined building blocks. They function to get you started _quickly_ and _easily_.

They connect several features, plugins and default values for a setup that will allow you to get your project underway.

The [preset template](./preset-template.md) can be used for proposing new presets.
