# About

The Extensible AFJ Project aims to increase self-sovereign identity interoperability and adoption. We want to make incorporating self-sovereign identity solutions into any kind op application as easy as possible by creating an ecosystem of plugins, presets and features using [Hyperledger Aries Framework Javascript](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript). Allowing **every** developer to integrate ssi into their project without hassle.

Components are proposed and worked on by the community. Currently we are working on [plugins](./plugins) and [presets](./presets). To get involved or make a proposal please read [How to Contribute](./how-to-contribute.md).

## Lifecycle

All proposals go through a small lifecycle where they move through set stages (_proposed_, _accepted_, _work in progress_ and _implemented_). Once a proposal has been made (according to the [guidelines](how-to-contribute.md)), it will be discussed within the community and moved along the lifecycle stages.
