# About

The Extensible AFJ Project aims to make the setup of self-sovereign identity solutions and the integration of self-sovereign identity functionality into any project _as easy as possible_.

We do this by creating an ecosystem of plugins, presets and features using [Hyperledger Aries Framework Javascript](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript). In order to increase the adoption of self-sovereign identity we are making it easy for developers to use existing technologies and connect to ssi projects already out there. Allowing _every_ developer to integrate ssi into their project without hassle.

Components are proposed and worked on by the community. Currently we are working on [plugins](./plugins) and [presets](./presets). To get involved or make a proposal please read [How to Contribute](./how-to-contribute.md).

## Lifecycle

All proposals go through a small lifecycle where they move through set stages (_proposed_, _accepted_, _work in progress_ and _implemented_). Once a proposal has been made (according to the [guidelines](how-to-contribute.md)), it will be discussed within the community and moved along the lifecycle stages.

### Plugins

Plugins facilitate easy integration with existing initiatives and technologies. To get more information or see the state of current plugins, visit [plugins](plugins/README.md).

### Presets

Presets allow developers to easily setup a type of agent/service with default values to keep or customise. To get more information or see the state of curent presets, visit [presets](presets/README.md).

## Roadmap

The Extensible AFJ Project is currently working towards applying for [eSSIF Lab Funding](https://essif-lab-infrastructure-oriented.fundingbox.com/) on 04-01-2021. For this deadline the aim is to have plugins in _proposed_, _accepted_ and _work in progress_ stages. And to have preset(s) in the _proposed_ stage.

### Timeline

- 11/2020: Move project to publicly available repo.
- 11/2020: Work out initial list of proposals.
- 11/2020: Setup scheduled community call (Friday 13:30 CET).
